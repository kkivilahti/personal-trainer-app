# Personal Trainer App
### Final project for Frontend Programming course

This project was created with React, Vite, and JavaScript.

The assignment consisted of four parts:
1. List pages for customers and trainings, with navigation between pages
2. Add, edit and delete functionalities for the list pages
3. Export feature for customer data, calendar page for viewing trainings, and deployment to the [cloud](https://personal-trainer-app-4xok.onrender.com/)
4. Statistics page that shows the total time of booked trainings

## What I learned
Through this project, I strengthened my skills in React, particularly in building reusable components and managing data flow between them. I also gained practical experience working with REST APIs, and learned how to implement CRUD features using external data sources.

In addition, I became more confident using third-party libraries such as Material UI, FullCalendar, and Recharts. Integrating these tools taught me how to work effectively with external components and adapt them to fit my project's needs. While learning to use new libraries, I also learned to interpret technical documentation better.

I believe this project also enhanced my debugging skills. The browser console alone can catch many bugs, and ESLint proved to be a valuable tool as well.
